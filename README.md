Scaffold for Node-base project allows you to install the scaffolding project with requied file structure, dependincies, etc.

First you need to have teh command create-node-base in you ./node_modules/.bin to have the following command in you local workspace.

Then, to generate the scaffold you can simply execute the following command:

`create-node-base  <%=FOLDER_NAME%> `

For example: create-node-base my-server will generate the project in my-server folder


TODO:

- beatify questions/answers in setupQuestions.js
