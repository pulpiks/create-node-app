Scaffold for Node-base project allows you to install the scaffolding project with requied file structure, dependincies, etc.

To generate the scaffold you can simply execute any of the following commands:

create-node-base  <%=FOLDER_NAME%> 

For example: create-node-base my-server will generate the project in my-server folder


You can install the scaffold typing the command:
create-node-base

or ./index.js (before chmod +x ./index.js)


TODO:
